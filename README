Script to draw text input in a gear font. They even rotate like gears! :D

RULES
Gears may only be drawn by stroking:
  • an arc over one of the 4 quadrants
  • a line starting at the center and meeting the radius at 45*n degrees

Not every character is supported, and some are identical (e.g. O and o). Here's every supported character (hint: try pasting this into the input):
