Script to draw text input in a gear font. They even rotate like gears! :D

Gears may only be drawn by stroking:
  • an arc over one of the 4 quadrants
  • a line starting at the center and meeting the radius at 45*n degrees

Not every character is supported, and some are identical (e.g. K and k). Here's every supported character (hint: try pasting this into the input):
AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHhIiJjKkLlMmNnOoPpQqRrSsTtUuVvWwXxYyZz0123456789 /\|<>()-_$%^?

Feel free to use this on your site, but I would appreciate credit and a link to my github repo.
