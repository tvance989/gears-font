A script to draw text input in a gear font. They even rotate!

Gears may only be drawn by stroking:
  • an arc in one of the 4 quadrants
  • a line starting at the midpoint and meeting the gear radius vertically, horizontally, or diagonally

Not every character is supported, and some are identical (e.g. K and k). Here's every supported character (hint: try pasting this into the input):

Feel free to use this on your site, but I would appreciate credit and a link to my github repository.
